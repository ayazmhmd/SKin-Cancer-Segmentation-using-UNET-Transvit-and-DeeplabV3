## Skin Cancer Segmentation using UNET with ResNet Backbone and DeeplabV3
### Project Overview
This project focuses on skin cancer segmentation using a sophisticated deep learning architecture. The goal is to accurately segment skin lesion images and provide accurate predictions of cancerous regions.

### Model Architecture
The model architecture comprises a UNET with a ResNet backbone and a DeeplabV3 head. The ResNet backbone extracts high-level features from the input images, while the DeeplabV3 head refines the predictions to enhance segmentation accuracy.

### Data Loading and Preprocessing
The skin cancer dataset includes images of skin lesions and corresponding segmentation masks. Images are resized to a uniform size and normalized to ensure consistent input for the model. Masks are preprocessed for binary classification.

### Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using a pixel-wise binary cross-entropy loss. The training loop includes both forward and backward passes, optimizing the model's parameters with an Adam optimizer. Model performance is evaluated using a validation dataset and monitoring loss convergence.

### Usage
Dependencies: Ensure the required libraries are installed. You can install them using pip or conda.

Dataset: Organize your dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. You can modify the data paths in the script according to your file structure.

Training: Run the training portion to train the skin cancer segmentation model. Adjust hyperparameters, learning rate, batch size, etc., as needed.

Prediction: After training, use the trained model to predict skin cancer segmentation masks for new images. Modify the paths in the prediction portion accordingly.

### Results
The model's segmentation accuracy is evaluated using various metrics, including IOU (Jaccard Index), Dice Coefficient, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and classification reports provide detailed insights into model performance across different classes (-1, 0, 1).

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining a UNET architecture with a ResNet backbone and DeeplabV3 head for skin cancer segmentation. The resulting model can accurately identify cancerous regions in skin lesion images, potentially aiding medical professionals in diagnosis and treatment planning.
